                    <p><h3>Assess the Add-Ons</h3>In Egypt taxes do count up as much as 25% of the original price, so you won’t really pay the price in your menu.<br/><br/></p>

                    <p><h3>Cross The Streets With Confidence</h3>In a crowded city it's normal that people cross huge streets quite often, don’t except somneone to wait for you.

                <li>
                    <p><h3>Respect The Dress Code And Culture</h3>In the cities/rural areas you need a cover and wear respectable clothes. However, in other resorts it would be fine to wear summer clothes.<br/><br/></p>

                <li>
                    <p><h3>Egypt Is Always Active</h3>Unlike other cities, in Egypt it’s never too late nor to early, you will always find something to do and people around. Eating out at 1 am is a common friday activity.<br/><br/></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><h3>Expect Diversity</h3>There are so many types of people in Egypt from party animals to meditation angels, and religious people, you can always find people to hang with , just search.<br/><br/></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><h3>Very Distinctive Cuisine</h3>Egyptians do respect food which leads to a great variety, make sure to try them , but first know what you can handle and what you can't.<br/><br/></p>

                </li>
                 <li>
                    <p><h3>Expect some attention</h3>Walking throught he streets you might grab the attention of a group of kids teliing you hello and asking how you are doing. They might even insist on practicing their French skills on you - whether you speak French or not.<br/><br/></p>
